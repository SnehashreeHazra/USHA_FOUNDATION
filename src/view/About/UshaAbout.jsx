            USHA – Universal Spiritual Human Awakening is a civilisational
            movement rooted in Vedic thought and cosmic consciousness. It is a
            response to the growing fragmentation of identity, faith, and
            society—a call to reconnect with universal principles that transcend
            time, geography, and doctrine. USHA aims to awaken a new global
            order anchored in spiritual harmony, knowledge equity, and Dhārmic
            living.
          </p>
          <p className="about-banner-text">
            At its core, USHA is not a religion, but a revival—a restoration of
            ṛta, the cosmic order. A conscious civilisation built on truth,
            reason, and oneness.

            If you have reached this far, there is a purpose, the purpose is
            bigger than what you think. You should have no doubt that you have
            been chosen for that bigger purpose. This is the purpose that you
            are born for, you are born for bigger things.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            If one thinks deeply, it will be evident that unifying forces
            between people are much more than those that separate us. Only three
            things give us separate existence, all based on where we are born
            into, and on which we had no control as an individual. Our religion,
            our history, and our geography give us our sense of identity in this
            world. Actually, the land to which we are born creates geographical
            boundaries, which in turn define our civilisational history, and in
            most cases, our faith. A person born in the Middle East has an 85%
            chance of being born into Islam, a person born in Europe has a 75%
            probability of being a Christian, and similarly, there’s almost an
            80% chance of being a Hindu if born in India.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Our sense of identity then creates behaviours that define one's
            culture. Culture is built in terms of the history of that particular
            place. Furthermore, religion itself was born into that geography,
            for the people who needed them at that point in time. From the point
            we are born till death, we wage infinite wars to protect this
            identity—thinking it’s the only place in the world for us. Most of
            our thoughts have been conditioned by these three variables between
            men.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            If one looks closely, it will be evident that each religion has
            three pillars: philosophy, ritual, and mythology. Most religions'
            philosophical bases are more or less the same and are geared towards
            unification, brotherhood, and the greater good. Rituals and prayer
            patterns, although different, do not bother people that much.
            However, mythology, which reflects civilisational and geographical
            narratives and claims of supremacy—convincing people that their path
            is the only path to God or Salvation—diverges greatly and creates
            animosity and hatred.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            With our education and lifelong experience, we can’t transcend these
            mental boundaries no matter where we live in today’s world. Since we
            are unable to choose the land and culture to which we are born, we
            take those as cardinal points and frame all our actions, thoughts,
            morality, ethics, beauty, and even whom we love or hate based on
            them.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            There are so many fields—especially medicine, physical science,
            technology, astronomy, geology, philosophy, sociology, psychology,
            literature, business, agriculture, and creative arts—that have no
            geographical identity per se. Some theories may have originated in
            certain regions, but there is no such thing as "Indian science" or
            "European science." We need to reorient our thoughts and actions
            around things that are universal, inclusive, and fundamental to our
            existence and well-being.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            I understand it’s easier said than done. However, if we cannot stop
            eating fried food, we can at least start walking 30 minutes per day
            to offset some of the negative effects. Likewise, I propose that we
            take baby steps toward finding the common denominators among all of
            us and use them as new cardinal points to shape our thoughts and
            future actions. The only thing that meets the three criteria of
            universality, fundamentality, and well-being is the Sun. The revival
            of solar worship and a brotherhood of USHA can help build
            psychological immunity against the germs of separateness that cause
            conflicts and wars.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Solar worship is one of the oldest and most widespread practices in
            the world. Every culture, in every age, has celebrated the Sun in
            some form. However, since the rise of organised religion around 4000
            years ago, humans have moved away from Nature and into speculative
            realms—creation, salvation, heaven, and hell.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            From Indians who worshiped the Sun god Surya and the 12 Adityas, to
            Egyptians who worshipped Ra and Aten, to the Greeks' Helios, the
            Romans' Sol Invictus, and the Germanic Sol—sun worship spans
            civilizations. In Kongo and Cameroon, the Sun is worshipped as
            Awondo. In China, it is Tai Yang Gong—the Grandfather Sun.
            Pre-Islamic Arabia worshipped Shams. Although Islam prohibits
            assigning divinity to objects, the Quran still mentions the Sun 33
            times. The Aztecs had Tonatiuh, the Inca had Inti, and the Mayan
            civilization traced its origins to Indian Maga Agnihotra priests,
            custodians of the Suryasiddhanta and Vastu Shastra. These Maga
            priests were known as Magi in the Bible—the three wise men from the
            East. They are believed to have journeyed from India to Persia and
            become the Asura Maya or Ahura Mazda—the Zoroastrian Sun god. Even
            Jesus Christ’s birthday—December 25—is aligned with the winter
            solstice, symbolic of the Sun’s rebirth.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            The pre-Christian pagan religion of Europe also worshipped Mithra—a
            Vedic Aditya conjoined with Varuna. Mitra represented the conscious
            mind and Varuna the subconscious. All these references highlight the
            universality and spiritual centrality of Sun worship across
            cultures, which is why the Sun—symbolised by USHA, the dawn—can be
            our unifying symbol of awakening and life.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            The new game cannot be played with old rules. We need fresh thinking
            and a catalyst to enable it. Organised religions have failed to stop
            human suffering and conflict. We must now form a small core team—a
            philosophical kernel—composed of modern scholars, technology
            experts, and influencers, rather than focusing on any one
            individual. This team would lay the foundation of a new ideology:
            USHAISM—an ideology of equality, inclusivity, and dialogic thinking.
            That is the new dawn—USHA.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            This core team will craft a new philosophical framework based on
            love, brotherhood, and unity—what the world needs today. The Western
            model of capitalism depended on democracy, which in turn is built on
            the belief in a just, singular God. But in a hyper-connected digital
            economy, governance must resemble an egalitarian commonwealth like
            the Ram Rajya or the peaceful Ajodhya of ancient times. For such
            governance, we need a unifying, evolving belief system. Solar
            worship, symbolised by USHA, can be that unifier.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Next, we must design rituals that suit today’s lifestyle. Reciting
            prayers without understanding, or repeating rituals in ancient
            languages, is ineffective. Prayer should be in the native language
            of the devotee, and not Hebrew or Sanskrit. We should also remove
            the concept of priests as intermediaries. A religion of love and
            peace must allow every human direct access to the divine.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Lastly, mythology must be simplified—free from exaggerated tales of
            demons, heroes, and the afterlife. Heaven and hell are human
            constructs. Discussions of cosmology should be left to science,
            which evolves with new facts. The only exception is the concept of
            reincarnation and karma, which creates long-term moral commitment.
            Let myths unite us—not divide us. Let each of us be the “chosen one”
            for one another's love and brotherhood—before aspiring to be God’s
            chosen.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            In conclusion, there is immense work ahead. We must cut through the
            rigid rocks of outdated belief, narrow boundaries, and ancient
            history. Like the Sun that shines equally on all, let each of us
            strive to make life better for everyone. Come and join the movement
            towards a new dawn—USHA: Universal Spiritual Human Awakening.
